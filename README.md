# Airline Customer Segmentation using LRFMC Model

Welcome to the Airline Customer Segmentation project! In this project,
we aim to analyze customer value using the LRFMC model (Length, Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Customer Cost) from the aviation dataset.

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy, 
allowing businesses to better understand their customers' value and preferences. 
By segmenting customers based on their value, airlines can personalize marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and optimize resource allocation.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the aviation dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
3. **Data Transformation**: Utilize the LRFMC model to calculate customer value metrics, including Length, Recency, Frequency, Monetary, and Customer Cost.
4. **Segmentation Analysis**: Apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their value, from low customer value to high customer value.

## Instructions
1. **Dataset**: Utilize the provided aviation dataset containing information about airline customers.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure, features, and distributions.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset by addressing missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies that may affect the analysis.
4. **Data Transformation**: Calculate the LRFMC metrics (Length, Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Customer Cost) for each customer based on their interactions with the airline.
5. **Segmentation Analysis**: Apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on their value metrics.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the segmentation results to understand the characteristics of each customer segment and identify opportunities for marketing and customer engagement strategies.

## Usage
1. **Dataset Setup**: Ensure that the aviation dataset is available in your working directory or specify the correct path to the dataset.
2. **Environment Setup**: Set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Explore, clean, and transform the dataset to prepare it for segmentation analysis.
4. **Segmentation Analysis**: Apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their value metrics.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the segmentation results and analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.

## Code Overview
The code provided includes the following sections:
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the aviation dataset and explore its features and distributions.
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
